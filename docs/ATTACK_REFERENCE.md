## [ // WIRELESS_ASSESSMENT_METHODS ]

### 1. PMKID Clientless Capture
- **Methodology**: Intercepts the Pairwise Master Key ID from the RSN IE during an association request.
- **Implementation**: `hcxdumptool -o [out] -i [iface] --enable_status=1`.
- **Technical Logic**: Exploits the RSN Information Element of the first EAPOL message.
- **[ // TECHNICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS ]**: 
    - **Physical**: Requires proximity to the Access Point (high RSSI for reliable frame capture).
    - **Logical**: Targets must utilize RSN (Robust Security Network) protocols. 
    - **Visibility**: Minimal. No deauthentication frames are broadcast, reducing likelihood of detection by wireless IDS.

### 2. WPS Entropy Analysis (Pixie-Dust)
- **Methodology**: Offline cryptographic analysis of the WPS PIN utilizing low-entropy nonces.
- **Implementation**: `reaver -i [iface] -b [bssid] -K 1 -vv`.
- **Technical Logic**: Targets predictable E-S1/E-S2 nonces generated by vulnerable chipsets.
- **[ // TECHNICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS ]**:
    - **Physical**: Stable signal environment required for the multi-stage WPS exchange.
    - **Logical**: Requires WPS version 1.0 or vulnerable 2.0 implementations.
    - **Implementation Note**: Many modern devices initiate "WPS Locking" mechanisms after sequential failed attempts.

### 3. WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture
- **Methodology**: Interception of the 4-way EAPOL exchange.
- **Implementation**: `airodump-ng` + `aireplay-ng --deauth`.
- **[ // TECHNICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS ]**:
    - **Prerequisite**: At least one active client must be associated with the target BSSID.
    - **Visibility**: Moderate to High. Deauthentication frames are detectable by enterprise wireless security systems and may trigger "MAC Spoofing" alerts.

## [ // NETWORK_ENUMERATION_PROFILES ]

### 1. TCP SYN Stealth Scanning
- **Methodology**: Half-open scanning via `nmap -sS`.
- **Implementation**: `nmap -sS -T2 -f -D RND:10 [target]`.
- **Technical Logic**: Sends SYN, waits for SYN/ACK, then immediately sends RST.
- **[ // TECHNICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS ]**:
    - **Evasion**: Packet fragmentation (`-f`) can potentially bypass certain stateless packet filtering rules by segmenting TCP headers.
    - **Timing Configuration**: `T2` (Polite) provides adequate spacing between probes to avoid triggering threshold-based rate-limiting or IDS alerts.

### 2. Physical & logical Enumeration
- **Methodology**: Analyzing protocol responses (TTL, Window sizes).
- **Tooling**: `WhatWeb`, `GoBuster`, `Enum4Linux`.
- **[ // TECHNICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS ]**:
    - **Context**: Accuracy is dependent on the target system's security posture. Hardened configurations (e.g., minimal service banners) will yield fewer artifacts than default installations.

## [ // AUTOMATION_&_WORKFLOW_LOGIC ]

Scenarios in VoidPWN act as high-level orchestrators, chaining multiple scripts with state management.

### Example: WiFi Audit Orchestration
1.  **Preparation**: Interface state transition to monitor mode via `airmon-ng`.
2.  **Survey**: Background sniffing to map the local signal environment.
3.  **Targeting**: Logic-based selection of high-signal targets for sequential assessment.
4.  **Capture**: Concurrent execution of PMKID and Handshake capture engines.
